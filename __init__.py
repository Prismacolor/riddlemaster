# goal of game is to answer ten riddles correctly to win a prize.
# player chooses a character
# eventually we'll have a picture for each character and will show them in pygame
# at each level the person will encounter a new creature
# if they guess the riddle correctly, they advance to next level
# if not they lose one turn until they have none remaining
# to do, figure out how to show number of lives on screen
# if they have no chances remaining they break out of the game loop and are given the option to try again
# trying again will start the game over
# to do: make it so they lose points/money but don't go back to zero?
# if they guess correctly, after every three levels ( 3, 6, 9) they'll have a side quest
# if they accept side quest they will go to side quest screen
# pick up item by colliding with it (pygame)
# add item to inventory
# how do we add a timer?
# when done, we'll return to the screen with the monster
# if successful, win points and money
# if not, monster will be sad
# continue to next level.
# after completing level ten, give title of riddle master

# TODO need to get images for game
